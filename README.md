# A text-based Barbooth game

###### [Download here](https://github.com/andreinonea/barbooth/releases)

This is a personal project so please do not expect much from it. **Barbooth** takes two player names, rolls two random dice and prints out the winner. The game features a round counter and a simple user interface. There are two game modes:
- "highs" designates the highst dice as the winner; 
- "lows" viceversa.

Future plans include:
- adding a log file in an user-chosen folder which stores a short history of recent games;
- creating a 'history' command to fetch that information;
- creating executable files for each Operating System. 

Any issues you have, feel free to contact me.
