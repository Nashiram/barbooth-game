# A text-based dice game

###### [Download here](https://github.com/andreinonea/barbooth/releases)

This is a personal project so please do not expect much from it. **Barbooth** takes two player names, rolls two random dice and prints out the winner. The game features a round counter and a simple user interface. There are two game modes:
- "highs" designates the highst dice as the winner; 
- "lows" viceversa;
- "classic" features the known way of playing: Each player takes turns and rolls both dice.
                                               The shooter wins if he throws 3-3, 5-5, 6-6 or 5-6 and loses if he throws 1-1, 2-2, 4-4 or 1-2.
                                               Other combinations are meaningless. The second player (the fader) usually places bets.

Future plans include:
- [ ] adding a log file in an user-chosen folder which stores a short history of recent games;
- [ ] creating a 'history' command to fetch that information;
- [ ] creating executable files for each Operating System.
