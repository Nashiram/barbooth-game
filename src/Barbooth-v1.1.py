# Barbooth 1.1 by Ano
# Copyright Â© 2018 Andrei Onea

# This game is probably illegal in some places but that does not matter
# as this is only a personal project. It takes two player names, rolls
# two random dices and prints out the winner. There are three game modes:
# "highs" designates the highst dice as the winner; "lows" viceversa;
# "classic" features the known way of playing: each player takes turns
# and rolls both dice. The shooter wins if he throws 3-3, 5-5, 6-6 or 5-6
# and loses if he throws 1-1, 2-2, 4-4 or 1-2. Other combinations are 
# meaningless. The second player (the fader) usually places bets.
# The game features a round counter and a decent user interface. Future
# plans include adding a log file in an user-chosen folder which stores
# a short history of recent games, creating a 'history' command to fetch
# that information and creating executable files for each Operating System. 
# This is a personal project so please do not expect much for it. 
# Any issues you have, you can contact me on the moon.
